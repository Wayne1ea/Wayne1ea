I served in the Arizona Army National Guard for 12 years as a Apache helicopter mechanic.  I have always been interested in how things work, 
especially computers and electronics.  I'm here because I became intersted in Arduino, in order to make that little thing work you have to know what C++ is and
how to use it in the Arduino IDE.  Many things intrest me and sometimes it's hard to stay on a specific task but I'm determined to expand my knowledge and hopefully
build some usefull things.
